This is a fork of
https://gitorious.org/jasonwoof/vim-syntax/commit/e22e5cbb1d8c6d90f4bbec27eeb15550c87bf6dd
which is the current official VIm syntax file for PHP (version from 2012-12-11
is bundled with VIm 7.4)


For now I just fix things I need and use daily.

See the commit log to see the changes from Jason Woofenden's version.
